## Animation Timing Reference

### Quick Timing Guide
```
FAST (0.3s):    Form focus glow, Input effects
MEDIUM (0.6s):  Entrance animations, Card slides
SMOOTH (0.8s):  Particle effects, Long transitions
SLOW (3-4s):    Continuous loops (glow-pulse)
INSTANT (∞):    Infinite loops, Background motion
```

### Easing Functions Used
```
cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)  → Smooth bounce feel
ease-out                             → Natural deceleration
ease-in-out                          → Smooth circular
linear                               → Constant speed

## The Magic Formula

**Great animations follow this pattern:**

1. **Entrance** (0.6s) - Element appears smoothly
2. **Idle** (infinite) - Subtle continuous effect (optional)
3. **Hover** (0.4s) - Interactive response
4. **Click** (variable) - Action feedback
5. **Exit** (0.3s) - Smooth departure

**Result**: Every element feels alive, responsive, and premium.
